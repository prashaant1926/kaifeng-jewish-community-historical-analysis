## Imperial Examination System Participation

### Key Evidence of Political Integration

- **1390**: Ming Taizu (Zhu Yuanzhang) granted Jews land and privileges
- **1421**: Imperial decree granting Jewish clan surname "Zhao"
- **Dramatic increase**: Number of Jews passing imperial examinations increased substantially
- **Peak community**: 17 clans, 500 households (~2,500 individuals)

### Government Service Documentation
- **Ai Tian encounter (1605)**: Met Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci in Beijing
  - Held official position in Chinese bureaucracy

## Government Policy Framework

### Historical Policy Analysis (Xu Xin)
- **Principle**: "Respecting their religion and changing not their customs and traditions"
- **Application**: Liberal policy toward all ethnic groups and faiths
- **1489 Stele Covenant**: Three-point agreement between emperor and Jews:
  1. "Become part of the Chinese [people]"
  2. "Honor and preserve the customs of your ancestors"
  3. "Remain and hand them down in Kaifeng"

### Contemporary Government Relations (2010-2024)
- **Non-recognition**: Neither religion nor ethnicity officially recognized by PRC
- **Surveillance**: Government monitoring and pressure on community
- **DNA Testing**: Government-conducted genetic testing (reported 2007)
- **Cultural suppression**: Synagogues destroyed, community centers closed
- **Documentation**: Families still identify as "Youtai" on official documents
